# grinminer.net 

## coming 2025 and seeking beta testers

### ties to community 
Home to Stratum for a Grin community miner that is the only permanent block producing testnet node and mining pool to support Grin development. 

### purpose
Offering services, applications, automation, and support to help Grin miner's with tooling to enhance mining to a non-Public solo Stratum pool. 


### products 
We are building platform independent web interfaces using Rust web apps to send and retrieve stats and status from Rust daemons running on Grin nodes/pools. 



### cypherpunk hosting 
Available Q1 2025 in addition to these tools we will rent private HA outbound nodes and solo pools featuring zero pool fee and a minuscule monthly cost to cover support by a 14 year veteran of self-hosting and running cost-effective IT departments for three local small businesses with no data breaches and zero outages. 

Inquire with Transatoshi about hosting for any other Grin related projects. 

### what we DON'T do:
-promise any earnings or performance boost regarding your ability to mine blocks
-force a contract or take PII to get a HA solo pool VPS rented 
-charge a fee on 60ãƒ„ blocks rewards you earn 
-fail to authenticate and encrypt miner traffic and stats like 99% of pools
-steal blocks like some sketchy pools
-use any third party hosting or VPS service secret backdoor
-answer to any authority 
-have profit as a goal
-seek outside funding 

## FOSS principled
It will be FOSS under MIT license so you can compile and use our tools for your own solo pool at home. We only charge a fee for hosting and support. 

### increased hashing and stability of the G1 mini
Also an overclocked version of the G1 mini v5.2.4 SD firmware is coming, and potentially a new updated openwrt firmware for the G1 mini with cgminer and stratum that isn't a buggy mess with a broken package manager.
