# grinminer.net

Home of the Grin communities permanent block producing testnet node and mining pool. 

Offering services, applications, automation, and support to help Grin miner's with tooling to enhance mining to a non-Public solo Stratum pool. 

We build platform independent web interfaces using Rust web apps to send and retrieve stats and status from Rust daemons running on hosted Grin nodes/pools with zero pool fee and a minuscule monthly cost to cover support. 

It will be FOSS so you can compile and use our tools for your own solo pool at home. 

Also an overclocked version of the G1 mini v5.2.4 SD firmware is coming, and potentially a new updated openwrt firmware for the G1 mini with cgminer and stratum that isn't a buggy mess that breaks updates.
